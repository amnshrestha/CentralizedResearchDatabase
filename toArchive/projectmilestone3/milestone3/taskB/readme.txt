Task B

Source of data:
Ideally we would get the information from the university library. However, we havenâ€™t yet been able to complete that part. Therefore, the data is populated by dummy values for now. 

The sql files in this directory are: create.sql and load.sql
To run the command, we used:
Mysql -u ashrest2 -p ashrest2_1<create.sql 
Mysql -u ashrest2 -p ashrest2_1<load.sql
And used our passwords.
